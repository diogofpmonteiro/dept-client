## Getting started

Run `npm install` to install project dependencies from package.json

I used json-server package to create a fake JSON REST endpoint.
To install run `npm install -g json-server`

Original github repo for the json-server package: https://github.com/typicode/json-server

To start the JSON server run:

### `json-server --watch db.json`

Now if you go to http://localhost:3000/, you'll see the endpoint result

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
